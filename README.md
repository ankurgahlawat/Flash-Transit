# Flash-Transit
Flash Transit is a web application that implements the concept of multimodal transport system and helps a user make
an efficient commute from a source to destination. The application first calculates the transit route using a bus route
and then splits the path according to certain checkpoints. Now, the user may prefer to either save their time or money.
If the user prefers to save time, then the cab cost for the leg of the transit which takes the longest time is calculated.
The total time spent is minimized in such a way and the user is shown their efficient way. Since, we were short of time we
couldn't fix certain minor bugs which are hindering us from displaying the most efficient path. We will fix the bugs and make
our algorithm more efficient by using real time fares and introducing metro and other transportation services in future iterations
